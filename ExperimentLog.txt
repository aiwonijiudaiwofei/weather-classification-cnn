TDatasets are in weather-classification-cnn/Dataset directory, each in a different folder. There are two folders for each category, since the images were marked with superpixels for their further processing in the cnn
The complete dataset is kept locally and online in a zip folder, the dataset directories in the Github repository are modified to match the structure required by the MatDeepRep/caffe framework
To create the required structures for training, the code will be divided in 70% Training and 30% Testing. This means that from the 1100 images in each category, 770 images would be for training purposes and 330 for testing
To generate the positive and negative training directories, each category's positive set is the original content of the dataset, and its corresponding negative set is a combination of the remaining datasets (For example: From the 1100 images in the Cloudy dataset, 770 are positive training and from each remaining category 192 images are taken, and an extra one from the following two categories to complete 770 negative examples)
To Execute code from MATLAB, open matlab and go to ~/Documents/caffe/matlab/demo and run the command [code,code_v] = matdeeprep('ResNet50', 'ExtendedWeatherDatabase', 'cloudy');
